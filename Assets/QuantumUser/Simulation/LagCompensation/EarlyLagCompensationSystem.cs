	/// <summary>
	/// EarlyLagCompensationSystem creates proxies which are destroyed later in LateLagCompensationSystem.
	/// This system must run before physics system.
	///
	/// How it works?
	/// =============
	/// As a local player, you see movement of all other player entity views being snapshot interpolated (not limited to players).
	/// But in simulation, other players are predicted.
	/// This system takes interpolation offset (in ticks) and interpolation alpha - both sent via input
	/// and creates a proxy entity (with LagCompensationProxy component) for each entity marked to be lag compensated LagCompensationTarget.
	/// These proxy entities represent state which player saw at the time of firing from a gun.
	///
	/// Because every player has different interpolation, colliders of proxies must have unique layer per player. Check LagCompensationUtility for more details.
	/// All proxies for PlayerRef:0 have layer 16,
	/// All proxies for PlayerRef:1 have layer 17,
	/// All proxies for PlayerRef:2 have layer 18, and so on
	/// When making lag compensation casts, you must use layer mask based on PlayerRef to hit correct proxies.
	/// Use mnethods from LagCompensationUtility.
	/// </summary>
